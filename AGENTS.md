# Coding Guidelines
* Properly handle errors and exceptions to ensure the software's robustness.
* Keep the code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
* Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Names should reveal intent. Function
  names should describe the action being performed.
* Only use comments when necessary, as they can become outdated. Instead, strive to make
  the code self-explanatory.
* When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not readily apparent
  from the code itself.
* Consider security implications of the code. Implement security best practices to protect
  against vulnerabilities and attacks.

# Project Guidelines
* Use Makefile targets to lint, build, test, and run the software rather than using `go
  {build,test,run} ...` directly
* When creating feature branches, use the format `<author>/<feature-name>` for the branch
  name
* Use the Github MCP for creating/managing PRs and issues. DO NOT use the `gh` CLI when
  MCP supports the equivalent actions
* When generating descriptions for commits and PRs, DO NOT mention that the changes are
  generated by an agent
* When attributing authorship, DO NOT attribute to the agent, but rather the user that is
  prompting you.
