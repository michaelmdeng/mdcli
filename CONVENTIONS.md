* Properly handle errors and exceptions to ensure the software's robustness.
* Keep the code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
* Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Names should reveal intent. Function
  names should describe the action being performed.
* Only use comments when necessary, as they can become outdated. Instead, strive to make
  the code self-explanatory.
* When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not readily apparent
  from the code itself.
* Consider security implications of the code. Implement security best practices to protect
  against vulnerabilities and attacks.
